/**
 * The JavaScript a browser downloads before a page can run (its first load), per route,
 * gzipped, against a budget: `bun run --cwd apps/web budget` after `next build` (CI runs
 * it after the end-to-end suite). A route over budget fails the run; so does the shared
 * part (what every route loads) growing past its own.
 *
 * Raise a budget only on purpose, in the same change that needs it, and say why. Most
 * growth is a dependency pulled into a client component that could stay on the server or
 * load lazily (`next/dynamic`).
 *
 * It reads Next.js's build manifests, which aren't a public API: a Next release that
 * changes them fails this with a message saying what's missing, rather than measuring
 * nothing and passing.
