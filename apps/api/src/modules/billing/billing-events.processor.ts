/**
 * Billing's share of domain events (`eventSubscribers["events-billing"]`):
 *
 *   - Stripe's (received and verified by apps/webhooks): any change to a subscription
 *     re-syncs it; a failed renewal also tells the organization's owners and admins;
 *   - membership changes: a paid plan's seat count follows the member count.
 *
 * Handlers are idempotent (syncs overwrite, seat updates are keyed, notifications use
 * the event id), so a redelivered event is harmless. It runs in the API because the API
 * owns the billing schema and holds the Stripe key; at scale it moves to its own worker
 * deployment unchanged.
