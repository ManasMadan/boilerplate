/**
 * Authentication (better-auth): the one place sign-in, sessions, organizations and
 * account security are configured. Clients use the better-auth client from
 * packages/client; oRPC procedures read the session through the `authed` middleware.
 * The hooks are in auth-hooks.ts and the larger plugins in auth-plugins.ts; what they
 * share is in auth-context.ts.
 *
 * Sessions are server-side and revocable. Each session lives in Redis (fast lookups on
 * every request) with a durable copy in Postgres (device list, audit). There is no
 * cookie cache: signing out or revoking a session deletes it, so the same cookie is
 * rejected on the very next request.
 *
 * Emails (sign-in codes, invitations) are never sent from here. They are queued for the
 * notification service, rendered in the recipient's language, and delivered with
 * retries, so a slow email provider can never slow down or fail a sign-in.
 *
 * After adding or removing a plugin, regenerate the auth tables (db-change skill).
