/**
 * Per-account limits on the endpoints that guess or send secrets, next to better-auth's
 * per-address ones (auth.ts `rateLimit`). A client address can be forged or rotated, so
 * an address limit alone doesn't stop someone trying passwords, second factors or codes
 * against one account from many addresses. These count per account (the normalised
 * email, or for a second factor the sign-in attempt's two-factor cookie) and fail
 * closed: if Redis can't answer, the attempt is refused.
 *
 * The cost is that someone can lock an account out of these endpoints for the window by
 * spending its attempts; a passkey or an existing session still works meanwhile.
