/**
 * Entry point for better-auth's CLI (`auth generate`), which reads the configuration to
 * produce the auth tables. It builds the real configuration with inert dependencies:
 * nothing connects to Postgres or Redis and nothing is sent. Rows go to an in-memory
 * store: plugins that write at startup (the OAuth provider seeds its resources) must not
 * need the tables being generated. `--adapter prisma` picks the output format. (better-auth
 * warns that the in-memory store generates no ids; nothing is kept, so that's expected.)
 * Used by the db-change skill: `bun run auth:schema`.
