"""Document summaries, as a LangGraph workflow: summarize each passage, then combine.

    START → summarize_passages → combine → END

A graph because it's the pattern for multi-step AI work here: each step is a node with
typed state, steps can be added (a quality check, a translation) without rewriting the
rest, and a checkpointer can be attached when a workflow needs to pause for a person.
This one doesn't pause: it runs inside one job, and a failed job simply runs it again.
Every step spends from one usage counter, capped by the limits the caller passes in (what
it reserved from the workspace's budget, see app/usage.py).

Each step calls the model through a Pydantic AI agent, so budgets and providers work
exactly as they do for the assistant. With "local:extractive", summaries are the
opening sentences of the text, for development and tests.
