"""Turning text into vectors for retrieval, behind one interface.

`ProviderEmbedder` uses any embedding model Pydantic AI knows ("openai:text-embedding-3-
small", Cohere, Voyage, a local server), asked for 1536 dimensions. `HashingEmbedder`
needs no model or key: it hashes words into the same 1536 dimensions, so similar wording
lands close together. It's lexical, not semantic: development and tests only (settings
refuse it in production).

Each embedder has a relevance floor (`min_score`, cosine similarity): passages below it
aren't returned at all, so a question the documents can't answer finds nothing instead
of the least-bad passage. For a provider model it's AI_MIN_RELEVANCE (default 0: the
model judges relevance itself); calibrate it with `bun run --cwd apps/ai evals` for your model.

Changing the dimension means a migration (ai.chunk's vector column) and re-indexing
every document (documents keep their text for that).
