/**
 * Where the relay hands committed events: the EventBus seam.
 *
 * Today: BullMQ. Each event is copied into every subscriber queue whose filter accepts
 * it (`eventSubscribers` in packages/jobs), with jobId = event id, so a redelivered
 * event is dropped while its job is kept, and consumers dedupe on the id beyond that.
 * Delivery is at least once and unordered.
 *
 * At scale: a log-based broker (Kafka, Redpanda, NATS JetStream). Implement `publish`
 * to produce each event to one topic keyed by `event.key`, bind it in outbox.module.ts,
 * and turn each consumer into a consumer group. The relay and every producer stay as
 * they are.
