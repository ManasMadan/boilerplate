/**
 * The outbox relay: moves committed events from every service's outbox to the EventBus.
 *
 * Each pass claims up to RELAY_BATCH_SIZE unpublished rows with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED,
 * publishes them, stamps published_at and commits. Any number of worker replicas can run
 * it at once: SKIP LOCKED gives each a different batch, so there's no leader to elect.
 * A crash after publishing but before the commit republishes the batch on the next pass;
 * the EventBus dedupes on the event id, so consumers still see each event once while its
 * job is kept (and are idempotent beyond that).
 *
 * It wakes on NOTIFY (sent by emitEvent when a transaction commits) through a direct,
 * non-pooled connection, and also polls every RELAY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS, so a lost
 * notification or a dropped listener only delays events, never loses them.
 *
 * Publishing happens inside the claiming transaction on purpose: the row locks are what
 * keep two relays from publishing the same batch. The transaction is short (one batch,
 * one Redis round trip) and has a timeout.
 *
 * At scale this is the OutboxSource seam: change data capture (logical replication or
 * Debezium reading the outbox tables) can replace polling and feed the same EventBus;
 * emitEvent and every consumer stay as they are.
