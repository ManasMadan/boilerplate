-- Whether an MCP access token's grant still stands: the user still approves the client
-- for that workspace (disconnecting deletes the consent) and is still a member of it.
-- Both MCP servers ask on every request, so disconnecting an app or leaving a
-- workspace takes effect at once, not when the token expires. One definition for
-- both languages; neither service needs the tables themselves.
