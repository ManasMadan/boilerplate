/**
 * Tenant isolation, enforced by Postgres row-level security.
 *
 * Tenant tables have a policy that only exposes rows whose org_id equals the
 * transaction-local setting `app.org_id`. These helpers set it for every query:
 *
 *   const db = withTenant(database.read, orgId);
 *   await db.todo.findMany();                          // only this org's rows
 *
 *   await tenantTx(database.write, orgId, async (tx) => {
 *     await tx.todo.update(...);                        // state change ...
 *     await tx.appOutboxEvent.create(...);              // ... and its event, atomically
 *   });
 *
 * Why this shape: the setting must be applied inside the same transaction as the query,
 * because the pooler (PgBouncer, transaction mode) hands each transaction a different
 * server connection. `withTenant` sends each query as a two-statement batch, so no
 * connection is held between statements. Multi-statement units use `tenantTx`, an
 * interactive transaction that holds one connection until it ends, so it must contain
 * database calls only: never await HTTP, Redis or queues inside it.
 *
 * Nested `$transaction` on a tenant client is blocked: Prisma would run each operation
 * in its own transaction there, silently breaking atomicity.
