 * (`isDefinedError(error) && error.code === "TODO_NOT_FOUND"`), the OpenAPI document
 * lists only those per operation, and every surface returns the same structure. The API
 * refuses, outside production, to answer a code a procedure didn't declare.
 * Procedures also carry metadata (ProcedureMeta): which API key scope lets a key call
