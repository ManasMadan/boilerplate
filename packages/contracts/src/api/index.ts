/**
 * The API contract: every procedure, its route, input, output and errors. The server
 * implements it (apps/api), clients call it (packages/client), and the OpenAPI document
 * for third parties is generated from it. Changing anything here is an API change:
 * CI compares the generated OpenAPI document against master and fails on breaking
 * changes (removed fields, new required inputs), which also protects older mobile apps.
