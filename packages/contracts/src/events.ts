/**
 * Domain events: facts that happened, published through the transactional outbox and
 * consumed by the audit log, customer webhooks and notifications.
 *
 * Names are versioned (`todo.completed.v1`). Adding an optional field is compatible;
 * anything else is a new version, published alongside the old one until every
 * consumer has moved (CI checks this: scripts/events-compat.ts). Consumers must be idempotent (events are delivered at least once)
 * and must not depend on order.
 *
 * Adding an event: define its payload here, emit it with `emitEvent(tx, ...)` in the
 * same transaction as the change, and add it to `webhookEvents` if customers may
 * subscribe to it. The audit log records every event automatically.
