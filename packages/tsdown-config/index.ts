/**
 * Build preset for every Node service.
 *
 * Output is one ESM bundle per service (`dist/main.mjs`) that inlines our own
 * `@repo/*` workspace packages (they ship TypeScript source) and leaves every npm
 * dependency external, resolved from node_modules at runtime. Keeping npm packages
 * external matters: several load files relative to themselves at runtime (BullMQ's
 * Lua scripts, pino transports, Prisma's query compiler WASM) and break when bundled.
 *
 * Decorator metadata comes from the service's tsconfig (`emitDecoratorMetadata`),
 * which Oxc honours; Nest's dependency injection depends on it.
