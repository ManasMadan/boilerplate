/**
 * The browser/mobile side of better-auth (server: apps/api/src/auth/auth.ts). Client
 * plugins mirror the server's plugins so their methods exist and are typed:
 * `authClient.emailOtp.*`, `authClient.twoFactor.*`, `authClient.passkey.*`,
 * `authClient.organization.*`, `authClient.admin.*`, `authClient.apiKey.*`,
 * `authClient.oauth2.*` (the consent page for apps connecting over OAuth).
 *
 * The OAuth provider plugin attaches the page's signed OAuth request (when the page was
 * opened by one, e.g. /sign-in?client_id=…&sig=…) to every request from that page, so a
 * sign-in there continues the app's authorization: the answer is `{ redirect, url }`
 * and the client navigates to it.
 *
 * Web uses `createAppAuthClient()`. Mobile builds its client from `authClientPlugins`
 * plus the Expo plugin (secure session storage), so both expose the same methods.
