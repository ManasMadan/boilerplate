 * The environment every test runs with, the same locally and in CI: `.env.example`'s
 * values (the ports docker compose publishes, local defaults), with its placeholder
 * secrets replaced by fresh ones. Variables already set win, which is how CI points the
 * tests at its own services. A developer's `.env` is never read, so a test can't pass only
 * because of what one machine has configured. A checkout with its own stack of services
 * (`.env.stack`, see stack.ts) gets that stack's ports, so its tests use its services.
 *
 * Each package with integration tests calls `applyTestEnvironment()` at the top of its
 * vitest.config.ts, before global setup and the test workers start (they inherit it).
 * The Python service does the same in apps/ai/tests/conftest.py.
