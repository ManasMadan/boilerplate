/**
 * Prisma's errors that mean something to a client, as catalog errors: a unique
 * constraint lost to a concurrent write is a conflict, a row gone between reading and
 * writing is not found, a transaction or connection that timed out is the service being
 * busy. Everything else stays an internal error. Both the API's procedures and the HTTP
 * error filter apply it, so a repository needn't catch them one by one (a call that
 * means something more specific, like PHONE_NUMBER_TAKEN, still catches its own).
