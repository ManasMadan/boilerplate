/**
 * Idempotency for mutations that must not run twice (payments, sends, expensive jobs).
 *
 *   const result = await idempotency.run(`${userId}:${idempotencyKey}`, chargeSchema, () =>
 *     billing.charge(...),
 *   );
 *
 * The first call runs the operation and stores its result for 24 hours; a retry with
 * the same key (the client lost the response, a proxy retried) gets the stored result
 * without running it again. A duplicate arriving while the first is still running is
 * rejected as a conflict rather than executed concurrently. Failures are not stored,
 * so a failed attempt can be retried with the same key.
 *
 * Keys must be scoped to the caller (user or org) so one tenant cannot replay another's.
 * A replayed result is parsed with the caller's schema: one that no longer matches fails
 * the request rather than run the operation twice or return the wrong type.
