/**
 * Fetch for URLs we don't control (customer webhook endpoints, links an AI tool follows).
 * A plain `fetch(url)` there is a server-side request forgery hole: a user registers
 * `http://169.254.169.254/...` or `http://postgres:5432` and makes our servers call
 * internal systems. This wrapper:
 *
 * - resolves the hostname itself and refuses it unless every address is public unicast
 *   (not loopback, private, link-local, cloud metadata, CGNAT, multicast; IPv4 and IPv6,
 *   including IPv4-mapped IPv6), with `resolvePermitted`, which checking a webhook URL
 *   on registration uses too; then connects to exactly the address it checked,
 *   so a DNS answer cannot change between check and connect;
 * - follows redirects itself (at most 3), re-checking each hop, or not at all with
 *   `followRedirects: false` (webhook delivery: a redirect would carry the body and its
 *   signature somewhere else, and Standard Webhooks senders don't follow them);
 * - requires https unless `allowHttp` is set, and caps time and response size.
 *
 * The network layer adds a second wall: the services' egress NetworkPolicies allow DNS,
 * their own namespace, the mail and observability namespaces, and the internet outside
 * private ranges, so another namespace, a node and a metadata address stay unreachable
 * even if a check here were wrong.
