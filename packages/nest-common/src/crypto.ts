/**
 * Encryption for secrets stored in our database (webhook signing secrets, third-party
 * tokens). AES-256-GCM with a key id on every ciphertext, so keys rotate without a
 * big-bang re-encryption:
 *
 *   ENCRYPTION_KEYS="2026-09:base64key,2026-01:base64oldkey"   (first = active)
 *   const box = new SecretBox(keysFromEnv(env.ENCRYPTION_KEYS));
 *   const stored = box.encrypt("whsec_...", `webhook_endpoint:${id}`);  // "v2.2026-09.<iv>.<ciphertext>"
 *   box.decrypt(stored, `webhook_endpoint:${id}`);  // any listed key id still decrypts
 *
 * The second argument names the row the value belongs to and is bound to the
 * ciphertext (GCM's additional data): a value copied into another row fails to decrypt,
 * so someone who can write the table can't make one endpoint sign with another's
 * secret. Values written before that (`v1`) still decrypt, without the check, and
 * `needsRotation` reports them.
 *
 * Rotation: prepend a new key, deploy, re-encrypt in the background (decrypt + encrypt
 * with the active key: `bun run --filter @repo/api secrets:reencrypt`), then drop the
 * old key.
 *
 * This is one of two schemes for secrets at rest. better-auth encrypts its own columns
 * (OAuth tokens, 2FA secrets, JWT signing keys) with `symmetricEncrypt` under
 * BETTER_AUTH_SECRETS; it has to, since better-auth reads and writes them itself.
 * Everything the app stores itself uses this one, which a KMS can take over (below).
 * The re-encryption job moves both onto their newest keys.
 *
 * Seam: keys come from a `KeyProvider`. Today it reads them from the environment (in a
 * cluster, the service's Secret, decrypted from SOPS by Argo CD). To use a KMS, implement
 * `KeyProvider` to unwrap data keys with the KMS; ciphertext format and callers stay the same.
