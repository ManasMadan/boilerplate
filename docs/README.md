# Docs

New here: the [README](../README.md) gets it running, [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
has the conventions, and [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) the fixes for what
usually goes wrong. Starting a new app from this repository:
[new-project.md](new-project.md), the checklist from the first clone to the first
production release. `CLAUDE.md` is the same material condensed for Claude Code.
