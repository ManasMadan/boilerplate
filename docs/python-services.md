# Python services

`apps/ai` is one Python 3.14 codebase that runs as two processes: a FastAPI app (port
8000) and a BullMQ worker. It owns the `ai` schema (documents, their chunks and
embeddings, token usage) and everything that calls a model. turbo drives it like the
TypeScript packages through a thin `package.json`; the Python tooling is uv.

## Who calls it

Only apps/api, through the generated client in `packages/ai-client` (see
[codegen.md](codegen.md)). The API has already authenticated the user, checked their
membership, and applied rate limits and input limits; every call carries a JWT it signed
for that call (HS256 with `AI_SERVICE_SECRET`, issuer `api`, audience `ai`, 60 seconds)
naming the user and organization (`app/auth.py`). The service trusts nothing else, and
every query is scoped to that organization by row-level security
(`tenant(org_id)` in `app/db/session.py`).

The one route reachable from outside is the MCP server at `/ai/mcp`, which checks OAuth
tokens itself (below).

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET /health/live`, `GET /health/ready` | probes (ready checks Postgres and Redis) |
| `POST /v1/sentiment` | the example model in `app/model.py`, a word-list classifier |
| `GET/POST /v1/documents`, `DELETE /v1/documents/{document_id}` | a workspace's documents; creating one queues indexing |
| `POST /v1/assistant/answers` | the assistant's answer, as server-sent events |
| `/ai/mcp` | the MCP server, when `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `API_URL` are set |

Errors have the API's own wire shape (`app/errors.py`), oRPC's error JSON as
`errorResponse` in `packages/contracts/src/api/base.ts` defines it:
`{defined, code, status, message, data: {params, requestId, issues}}`. The model, the
`ErrorCode` Literal and each code's status are generated from `packages/contracts`
(`app/contracts/error_response.py`, `error_codes.json`), so raise `AppError("CODE",
params)`: a code outside the catalog doesn't type-check, and the status always comes
from the catalog. A status the framework answers with that has no code of its own (405,
say) becomes `BAD_REQUEST` 400, or `INTERNAL` 500 for a 5xx. Every route declares the
model (`responses` in `app/main.py`), so `packages/ai-client` parses errors against it
instead of guessing. The API passes `DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND`, `AI_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`,
`FEATURE_DISABLED` and `VALIDATION_FAILED` on to clients; anything else becomes
`UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`.

## Documents and retrieval

Creating a document stores its text and queues an `ingest` job (`app/documents.py`).
The worker splits it into passages (`app/chunking.py`: paragraphs up to 1200
characters, split on sentence ends, 150 characters of overlap), embeds them in batches
and stores them in `ai.chunk`, a pgvector column with an HNSW cosine index. Search is
nearest-neighbour within the caller's organization.

Embeddings go through the `Embedder` interface (`app/embeddings.py`):
`ProviderEmbedder` for any Pydantic AI embedding model (`AI_EMBEDDINGS`), asked for 1536
dimensions, or `HashingEmbedder`, which hashes words into the same space with no model
(lexical, development and tests only). Passages below the relevance floor
(`AI_MIN_RELEVANCE`, cosine similarity) aren't returned, so a question the documents
can't answer finds nothing. Changing the dimension means a migration and re-indexing
every document.

## The assistant

`app/assistant.py`: a Pydantic AI agent with one tool, `search_documents`. It streams
`AssistantEvent`s: text as it's written, the documents it used, then the tokens it cost.
Retrieved text is treated as data (the instructions say so, and clients render answers
as plain text).

- **Models**: `AI_MODEL`, with `AI_FALLBACK_MODEL` when it fails. An LLM gateway is just
  another model name. Unset `AI_MODEL` turns the assistant off (`FEATURE_DISABLED`).
- **Budgets** (`app/usage.py`): before streaming starts, each answer reserves up to
  `AI_TOKENS_PER_RUN` from what's left of the workspace's monthly allowance
  (`AI_MONTHLY_TOKENS_PER_ORG`), under a per-workspace lock so concurrent answers can't
  all fit into the same remainder; nothing left is a normal `AI_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`
  response. The answer is capped at what it reserved, and records what it actually used
  however it ends: answered, stopped at the limit (`AI_RUN_LIMIT`), failed, or abandoned
  by the client. The run happens in its own task, so a client that goes away stops it
  between events and the accounting still finishes. `ai.usage` is append-only for this
  service, so a reservation is one row and settling it adds the difference; the month's
  sum is what counts, and a run that never settles (the process died) keeps its
  reservation.

## Summaries

`app/summaries.py` is a LangGraph workflow: `summarize_passages` then `combine`, each
step a Pydantic AI agent, so budgets and providers work as for the assistant. When a
model is configured, indexing queues a `summarize` job that runs it and stores the
summary on the document. It reserves and settles its tokens like an answer; a workspace
with nothing left gets no summary, and a document that needs more than one run may spend
ends without one instead of failing the job, which would only spend it again on retry. It's the pattern for multi-step AI work: add a node (a quality
check, a translation) without rewriting the rest.

## Local stand-ins

Nothing needs a model or key in development:

- `AI_MODEL=local:extractive` answers by quoting the best passage, and summaries are the
  opening sentences of the text;
- `AI_EMBEDDINGS=hashing` embeds without a model.

`.env.example` sets both. `settings.py` refuses them when `NODE_ENV=production`. For a
real model, set `AI_MODEL`, `AI_EMBEDDINGS` and the provider's key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`) with `bun run env:set`.

## The worker

`app/worker.py` consumes `ai-ingest` (`ingest` and `summarize` jobs), validating each
against its own generated model (`app/contracts/ai_ingest_<job>_job.py`) and binding the
request id it was queued with to its logs. The models ignore fields they don't know, so
a newer producer can add an optional field without an older worker rejecting the job,
and the job names are a generated `Literal`: a job added in `packages/jobs` is a type
error in the worker until it's handled. A failure throws, and BullMQ retries with the same backoff the TypeScript
side uses (the queue settings are generated from `packages/jobs`). It publishes a live
nudge to the organization when a document changes, so the web app refreshes
(`app/realtime.py`: the message models and the channel's Redis name are generated from
`packages/contracts/src/realtime.ts`, so both sides agree on them).

In Kubernetes it's the `ai-worker` deployment (same image, `python -m app.worker`,
scaled by KEDA on the queue). Locally `bun dev:full` starts both (apps/ai's `dev` runs
FastAPI and the worker, which restarts when a Python file changes). To run the worker on
its own, without reloading:

```sh
bun run --cwd apps/ai worker
```

## The MCP server

`app/mcp_server.py` serves the approved workspace's documents to MCP clients: tools
`list_documents` and `search_documents`, both needing the `documents:read` scope. Every
request needs an OAuth access token from the API's authorization server for this
resource (RFC 8707 audience `<site>/ai/mcp`), signed with a key from the API's JWKS
(fetched from `API_URL`), naming a workspace, whose grant is still active
(`auth.mcp_grant_active`). Calls are limited to 60 a minute per app and user. A tool
that fails is logged with its request id (the `x-request-id` header, or a fresh one) and
answers `INTERNAL` with that id; what went wrong never reaches the client. See
[auth.md](auth.md) for the OAuth side.

To add a tool: give it a scope in `packages/contracts/src/mcp.ts` (and the API's resource
policy in `apps/api/src/auth/auth.ts`), register it in `create_mcp_server` behind that
scope, and cover it in `tests/test_mcp.py`.

## Database models

Prisma owns the DDL (`packages/db/prisma/schema/ai.prisma`). `app/db/models.py` describes
the same tables in SQLAlchemy, and `tests/test_models_match_db.py` fails when they drift
from the migrated database. The service connects as `app_ai`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bun run --cwd apps/ai dev` | FastAPI with reload on :8000 and the queue worker, restarted on changes (part of `bun dev:full`) |
| `bun run --cwd apps/ai worker` | the queue worker alone |
| `bun run --cwd apps/ai test` | pytest without the integration tests (part of `bun run test`) |
| `bun run --cwd apps/ai test:integration` | the tests that need Postgres and Redis (part of `bun run test:integration`) |
| `bun run --cwd apps/ai coverage` | every test, with the 95% floor in `pyproject.toml` |
| `bun run --cwd apps/ai evals` | the evals (below) |
| `bun run --cwd apps/ai check-types` | basedpyright, strict |
| `bun run --cwd apps/ai lint` | ruff check and format check |

## Evals

`apps/ai/evals` runs the assistant and the summarizer against a fixed handbook
(`evals/corpus.py`) with pydantic-evals, using `AI_MODEL`, `AI_EMBEDDINGS` and
`AI_MIN_RELEVANCE` from the environment:

```sh
bun run --cwd apps/ai evals
AI_MODEL=anthropic:claude-sonnet-5 AI_EMBEDDINGS=openai:text-embedding-3-small \
  EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL=anthropic:claude-sonnet-5 bun run --cwd apps/ai evals
```

With the local stand-ins (every CI run) they check the pipeline around the model:
retrieval, the relevance floor, tools, refusals, prompt-injection resistance and
summaries. With real providers the same cases measure the model; `EVAL_JUDGE_MODEL` adds
LLM-judged rubrics. The run fails below `EVAL_MIN_PASS_RATE` (default 1.0). Use them to
calibrate `AI_MIN_RELEVANCE` for a new embedding model. Nightly CI runs them against the
model in the `EVAL_MODEL` repository variable (see
[repository-settings.md](repository-settings.md)).

To add a case: put the facts it needs in `evals/corpus.py` and the question in
`evals/__main__.py`, with the checks from `evals/evaluators.py` that define a good answer.

## Adding an endpoint

1. Define request and response models (`app/schemas.py`, or the feature's module) and the
   route in `app/main.py`, with an `operation_id` (it becomes the TypeScript function
   name) and `CallerDep` for the caller. Blocking work (inference) uses a plain `def` so
   FastAPI runs it in a thread; I/O uses `async def`.
2. Query through `tenant(caller.org_id)`.
3. `bun run gen`: regenerates `apps/ai/openapi.json` and `packages/ai-client/src/generated`.
4. Add a method for it to `createAiClient` in `packages/ai-client/src/index.ts`, call it
   from `apps/api/src/modules/ai/ai.service.ts`, and expose it through a procedure in
   `packages/contracts/src/api/ai.ts` and a hook in `packages/client/src/api/ai/`.
5. Tests in `apps/ai/tests` (mark ones that need Postgres or Redis with
   `@pytest.mark.integration`).

A new module is a file under `app/`. Anything that must never block a request goes to
the worker as a job on `ai-ingest`, or on a new queue (see
[jobs-and-events.md](jobs-and-events.md)).
