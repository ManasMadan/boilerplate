/**
 * Stop: if this turn changed files, run the fast checks on what changed (checks.ts:
 * Biome on the changed files; lint, types and unit tests of the affected packages; types
 * of scripts/ and the hooks when they changed, which turbo can't see; the unit tests of
 * what changed with coverage, failing on a changed line they don't cover
 * (scripts/unit-coverage.ts); knip) and send Claude back to fix what fails. Guard rails:
 * - skipped when the working tree's content is what it was at the prompt (turn-start.ts);
 * - capped at 60 seconds: a timeout tells Claude which checks didn't run and blocks until
 *   it has run them, so a slow check is never a silent pass;
 * - re-checks after every fix, up to 3 times a turn, so a fix is verified too and a stuck
 *   turn can't loop forever (the user is told when the cap is reached);
 * - asks for the full checks once per state of the tree: after Claude has run them, the
 *   same unchanged tree isn't asked about again.
 * Integration and e2e tests need Docker and minutes: the verify skill and CI run those.
