name: rotate-secrets
description: Rotate or replace a secret or key (ENCRYPTION_KEYS, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET, AI_SERVICE_SECRET, customer webhook signing secrets, provider keys). Use when a secret leaked, a key is due for rotation, or the user asks how rotation works here.

# Rotate secrets

Where secrets live: locally in `.env` (never read it; set values with
`bun run env:set KEY=value`). Deployed, in SOPS-encrypted Kubernetes Secrets committed
to git: `deploy/environments/<env>/secrets/<service>.sops.yaml`, each a Secret named
`boilerplate-<service>` whose `stringData` holds that service's variables (platform
Secrets, such as the Cloudflare token, are in `deploy/platform/secrets/<env>/`). Argo CD
decrypts them into the cluster when the change reaches master (deploy/README.md,
"Secrets with SOPS"). Services read variables at start, so restart the affected
deployments once Argo CD has synced
(`kubectl -n boilerplate rollout restart deployment/boilerplate-<service>`).

Never decrypt a secrets file yourself (`sops -d`, `sops <file>`, `sops decrypt`): that
puts the values in the conversation. The user edits them with `sops <file>`, which opens
the decrypted Secret in their editor and encrypts it again on save; give them the exact
file and key to change. A brand-new value that nobody needs to see can be written
without showing it: `sops set <file> '["stringData"]["KEY"]' "\"$(openssl rand -base64 32)\""`.
Commit only encrypted files (`charts:check` and the pre-commit hook refuse plain ones).

## ENCRYPTION_KEYS (webhook signing secrets at rest)

`id:base64key` entries, 32-byte keys; the first encrypts, every listed one decrypts
(`packages/nest-common/src/crypto.ts`). api and webhooks must hold the same value.

1. New key: `echo "$(date +%Y-%m):$(openssl rand -base64 32)"`.
2. Prepend it, keeping the old one: `ENCRYPTION_KEYS: "<new>,<old>"` in both the api's
   and the webhooks' Secret (the user edits both with `sops`). Commit, wait for Argo CD's
   sync, restart api and webhooks. Locally the user edits `.env` themselves
   (you can't read the old value); only if local webhook endpoints don't matter, set a
   fresh single key with `bun run env:set`.
3. Re-encrypt the stored secrets with the new key (safe while the services run, safe
   to repeat): `bun run secrets:reencrypt` locally; deployed, a Job from the stack's
   suspended CronJob:
   `kubectl -n boilerplate create job --from=cronjob/boilerplate-reencrypt reencrypt-$(date +%s)`,
   then `kubectl -n boilerplate logs -f job/<that job>`. Never `kubectl exec` it into a
   running api pod: the second process shares the pod's memory limit and gets the api
   OOM-killed. It prints how many rows moved; a second run prints 0.
4. Only then drop the old key from both Secrets, commit and restart. Dropping it earlier makes
   endpoints still on it undeliverable ("Unknown encryption key").

Never replace the only key: every stored secret encrypted with it becomes unreadable.

## Customer webhook signing secrets

Per endpoint: the "Rotate secret" button in workspace settings (the `webhooks.rotateSecret`
procedure, owners and admins). The old secret keeps signing next to the new one for
`WEBHOOK_SECRET_OVERLAP_HOURS` (24, `packages/contracts/src/api/webhooks.ts`): each
delivery carries both signatures, so the customer's receiver accepts it with either
secret while they switch. Rotating again inside the window drops the oldest. It records
`webhook.secret_rotated.v1` in the audit log. For a leaked secret, rotate twice: the
second rotation retires the leaked one at once.

## Shared secrets (UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET, AI_SERVICE_SECRET)

Both sides must change together: UNSUBSCRIBE_SECRET in api and notifications,
AI_SERVICE_SECRET in api and ai (`apps/ai/app/settings.py`). Set the new value in both
services' Secrets, commit, restart both once synced. Unsubscribe links in emails already
sent stop working; AI calls fail until both sides run the new value (tokens live 60 s).

## BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

better-auth signs session cookies with it and encrypts OAuth tokens, two-factor secrets
and backup codes, and the JWT signing keys (OAuth and MCP tokens) with it. Never just
replace it: everything encrypted becomes unreadable. Rotate with versioned secrets
(`apps/api/src/auth/secrets.ts`):

1. Generate one: `openssl rand -base64 48`. Set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRETS` for the api,
   newest first: `1:<new>` the first time, then `2:<newer>,1:<new>` and so on. Keep
   `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` as it is: it still decrypts values written before versions.
   Deployed, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRETS` goes in the api's Secret; locally
   `bun run env:set BETTER_AUTH_SECRETS=1:<new>`.
2. Commit, and restart the api once synced. Every session cookie is signed with the newest secret
   only, so everyone signs in again once; nothing else breaks.
3. Re-encrypt: `bun run secrets:reencrypt` (deployed: the `kubectl create job` command in
   the ENCRYPTION_KEYS section). It moves every stored value to the newest version.
4. Then older versions can go from `BETTER_AUTH_SECRETS`. The legacy
   `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is still required by the api's environment; once re-encryption
   has run, its value no longer protects anything and can be replaced with a fresh one.

## STALWART_WEBHOOK_SECRET (the mail server's bounce webhook)

Stalwart signs with one key; the webhooks service accepts several, comma-separated.

1. New key: `openssl rand -base64 32`. In the webhooks Secret, set
   `STALWART_WEBHOOK_SECRET: "<new>,<old>"`; commit, restart webhooks once synced.
2. Give Stalwart the new one: the same key in the mail server's Secret (`stalwart` in
   namespace `mail`, under `deploy/platform/secrets/<env>/`), then restart it
   (`kubectl -n mail rollout restart statefulset/mail`); its settings plan re-applies on
   start.
3. Drop the old key from the webhooks Secret, commit, restart webhooks.

Locally: `bun run env:set STALWART_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<new>` and `bun run db:up:mail`.

## Provider keys (Stripe, Twilio, FCM, APNs, Google, Turnstile)

Create the new key at the provider, put it in the Secret of the service that uses it
(`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` belongs to webhooks, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and the Turnstile keys
to api, the push and SMS keys to notifications; see each app's `src/env.ts`), commit,
restart that service once synced, then revoke the old key.

## A cluster's age key

It decrypts every Secret of its environment. To replace it: `age-keygen` a new pair, put
the new public key in `.sops.yaml` next to the old, `sops updatekeys` every file of that
environment, commit; replace the `sops-age` Secret in `argocd` (the bootstrap's
`sops_age_key`, `infra/tofu/README.md`) and restart the repo server; then remove the old
public key from `.sops.yaml` and `updatekeys` again. A leaked key means every secret it
could decrypt is leaked too: rotate those values as well.
