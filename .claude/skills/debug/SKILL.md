description: Find out why something fails locally, in CI or in a deployed environment. Use when the user reports an error, a failing request, a job that never ran, an email that never arrived, or a service that won't start.

# Debug

Reproduce first, then read the logs for that one request. Fix the cause, not the
symptom (CLAUDE.md principle 1).

## Follow one request

Every HTTP request gets an id, returned in the `x-request-id` response header and in
every API error's `data.requestId` (`errorRequestId` in `packages/client/src/errors.ts`).
The same id is the `requestId` field on every log line
written for that request, and it travels with queued jobs and outbox events, so one
search covers api → queue → worker → notifications.

- Local: the turbo UI (`bun dev`), one pane per service. Pretty logs in development,
  JSON elsewhere; `LOG_LEVEL=debug` via `bun run env:set LOG_LEVEL=debug` for more.
- After `bun run test:e2e`: `logs/<service>.log` for every service it started.
- A cluster: `kubectl -n boilerplate logs deploy/boilerplate-<service> | grep <requestId>`
  (previews: namespace `pr-<number>`).

## Where to look

1. `bun run doctor`: tools, `.env` drift (a variable in `.env.example` missing from
   `.env`), services up.
2. A service exits at boot: its `src/env.ts` (t3-env) names the variable that failed
   validation. Set it with `bun run env:set KEY=value`; never read `.env`.
3. Local services: `docker compose logs <postgres|valkey|mailpit|rustfs|clamav> --tail 100`.
   `bun run db:up` refuses to start containers that don't fit in Docker's memory and
   says so.
4. Types or imports missing after a pull: `bun run gen`. Tables missing:
   `bun run db:deploy`.

## Common failures

| Symptom | Usual cause |
|---|---|
| A list is empty for data that exists | query not run through `withTenant`/`tenantTx`, or the wrong org (row-level security hides it) |
| `permission denied for table` | the migration has no grant for that service's role (db-change skill) |
| `NO_ACTIVE_ORGANIZATION` | the session has no active workspace, or the user left it |
| `FEATURE_DISABLED` | the feature's variables aren't set (`apps/api/src/features.ts`) |
| `CLIENT_OUTDATED` | the app sent `x-app-version` below `MINIMUM_CLIENT_VERSION` |
| Email or code never arrives | notifications isn't running, or it went to Mailpit (http://localhost:58025) |
| Job queued, never processed | the consuming service isn't running (`bun dev` starts the core ones; ai's worker is `bun run --cwd apps/ai worker`) |
| Event handled twice or out of order | consumers must be idempotent on the event id and order-independent |
| AI calls fail with `UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` | apps/ai isn't running (`bun dev:full`) or `AI_URL`/`AI_SERVICE_SECRET` differ |

## CI

`gh run list --branch <branch>`, then `gh run view <id> --log-failed`. Run the same
command locally (`bun run lint`, `bun run check-types`, `bun run test`); integration and
e2e failures usually reproduce with `bun run test:integration` and `bun run test:e2e`.
