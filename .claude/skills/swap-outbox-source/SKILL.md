description: Replace the outbox relay's polling with change data capture (logical replication, Debezium). Use when outbox polling load or event latency becomes a problem, or the user asks about CDC for domain events.

# Swap the outbox source

There is no interface for this yet: the replaceable unit is the relay itself,
`OutboxRelay` in `apps/worker/src/outbox/relay.service.ts`, which feeds the `EventBus`.

- **Today:** each pass claims unpublished rows from every `<schema>.outbox_event` listed
  in `apps/worker/src/outbox/sources.ts` with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, publishes them,
  and stamps `published_at`. It wakes on `NOTIFY` (a direct connection) and polls as a
  fallback. Any number of worker replicas can run it.
- **Env:** `WORKER_DATABASE_DIRECT_URL` (LISTEN), `RELAY_BATCH_SIZE`,
  `RELAY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (`apps/worker/src/env.ts`).

## Swap

1. A CDC reader (a logical replication slot on the outbox tables, or Debezium) that
   hands each committed row to `EventBus.publish` as an `EventEnvelope` (same parsing
   as the relay: unknown event names are passed through, not dropped).
2. Replace `OutboxRelay` in `apps/worker/src/outbox/outbox.module.ts` with it. `emitEvent`,
   the outbox tables and every consumer stay as they are.
3. Retention: the `outbox-retention` maintenance job purges rows by `published_at`, so
   the reader must still stamp it, or retention must change to match.
4. Replication needs a role with `REPLICATION` and a slot per environment: a migration
   can't grant that; it's `infra/postgres/init` locally and OpenTofu or CloudNativePG in
   clusters. An abandoned slot holds WAL forever: monitor it.

## Tests

The `outbox relay` tests in `apps/worker/test/worker.integration.test.ts` (delivery,
crash and redelivery, several relays at once) must pass unchanged against the new source.
