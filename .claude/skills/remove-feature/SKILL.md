name: remove-feature
description: Remove an optional feature a product doesn't need (billing, the AI assistant, file uploads, customer webhooks, Google sign-in, captcha, SMS, push, the mobile app, the example todos) completely - code, tables, env, copy, docs and tests - without breaking a running deployment. Use when the user wants to drop a feature from their product, not merely leave it switched off.

# Remove a feature

Every optional feature is off until its variables are set (`apps/api/src/features.ts`),
so an unused one costs code, not runtime. Remove it when the product will never use it
and the code is in the way. Work on a branch; the change is large and goes through
review like any other.

## Find everything it touches

Start from its names: `git grep -n -i "<feature>"` for its module names, env variables,
error codes, events, queues and i18n namespaces. The table is where each one lives:

| Feature | Its code and config |
|---|---|
| Billing | `apps/api/src/modules/billing`, `packages/contracts/src/billing.ts` and `api/billing.ts`, `packages/fake-stripe`, `apps/webhooks/src/inbound/stripe.routes.ts`, `apps/web/src/modules/billing` and `(app)/settings/billing`, `packages/db/prisma/schema/billing.prisma`, `STRIPE_*`, the `events-billing` queue, `billing.*` copy, `docs/files-and-billing.md`, `apps/web/e2e/billing.spec.ts` |
| AI assistant and documents | `apps/ai`, `packages/ai-client`, `apps/api/src/modules/ai`, `packages/contracts/src/api/ai.ts`, `apps/web/src/modules/assistant` and `(app)/assistant`, `ai.prisma`, the `ai-ingest` queue, `AI_*`, the `ai` and `ai-worker` chart services and image, CI's `python` and `evals` jobs, `docs/python-services.md`, `assistant.spec.ts` |
| File uploads | `apps/api/src/modules/files`, `apps/worker/src/files`, `packages/nest-common/src/storage.ts`, `packages/contracts/src/files.ts` and `api/files.ts`, `files.prisma`, the `files` queue, `S3_*`, `FILE_SCANNER`, `CLAMAV_URL`, RustFS and ClamAV in `docker-compose.yml` and the charts, `avatar.spec.ts` |
| Customer webhooks | `apps/webhooks/src/outbound`, `apps/api/src/modules/webhooks`, `packages/contracts/src/api/webhooks.ts`, `(app)/settings/webhooks`, the endpoint and delivery tables in `webhooks.prisma`, the `events-webhooks` and `webhook-deliveries` queues, `WEBHOOK_*`, `webhookEvents` in `packages/contracts/src/events.ts`, `webhooks.spec.ts` |
| Google sign-in | `socialProviders` in `apps/api/src/auth/auth.ts`, `GOOGLE_*`, the Google button in the auth pages, `google.spec.ts` |
| Captcha | `apps/web/src/components/captcha.tsx`, the captcha check in `apps/api/src/auth/auth.ts`, `TURNSTILE_*`, the Turnstile widget in `infra/tofu/modules/cloudflare`, `captcha.spec.ts`, `captcha.integration.test.ts` |
| SMS and phone numbers | `apps/api/src/modules/user/phone.service.ts`, `apps/notifications/src/channels/sms`, `SMS_PROVIDER`, `TWILIO_*`, `sms.*` copy, `phone.spec.ts` |
| Push | `apps/notifications/src/channels/push`, the devices procedures, `apps/web/public/sw.js`, `apps/mobile/src/lib/push.ts`, `FCM_*`, `APNS_*`, `VAPID_*`, `push.spec.ts` |
| The mobile app | `apps/mobile`, `.github/workflows/mobile.yml`, `EAS_PROJECT_ID`/`EXPO_TOKEN`, `mobile.*` copy, the `mobile` commit scope, `MINIMUM_CLIENT_VERSION` if nothing else needs it |
| The example todos | `apps/api/src/modules/todo`, `packages/contracts/src/api/todo.ts`, the todo hooks in `packages/client/src/api/todo`, the dashboard's todo list, the `Todo` model in `app.prisma`, `todo.*` events, the api's MCP tools, `load/api.ts`, `todos.spec.ts`. Replace them with your first real feature first: every layer's docs point at them as the example |

## Remove it, in this order

1. **Clients first**: its pages, components, hooks and routes in `apps/web`,
   `apps/mobile` and `packages/client`; its entries in `APP_PATHS` and navigation.
2. **The API and services**: the module and its registration in `app.module.ts` and
   `src/rpc/router.ts`; its contract files and their entries in
   `packages/contracts/src/api/index.ts`; its switch in `features.ts` and `FEATURES`
   (`packages/contracts/src/api/system.ts`); processors, queues in
   `packages/jobs/src/queues.ts` and routes in `eventSubscribers`; error codes only it
   throws; API-key scopes and entitlements only it uses.
3. **Events.** Stop emitting its events, but leave their names in
   `packages/contracts/src/events.ts` and the audit labels in i18n: the audit log still
   shows past entries, and customers' webhook payloads are a public contract (remove a
   `webhookEvents` entry only with a breaking-change note).
4. **The database, expand then contract.** The release that removes the code keeps the
   tables: the previous release still runs against the schema during the rollout and
   after a rollback. Drop the tables, grants and functions in a later release's
   migration, once nothing running reads them (the db-change skill), and remove the
   models from `packages/db/prisma/schema/` in that same change.
5. **Env and deploy**: its variables from each `src/env.ts`, `.env.example`,
   `docs/environment.md`, the chart values and the Secret templates in
   `docs/new-project.md`; its chart services, add-ons, images (`docker-bake.hcl`, the
   workflows' image lists) and compose services. Tell the user which SOPS keys to delete
   (you don't edit those files).
6. **Copy.** Its i18n keys from every catalog, except the audit labels above.
7. **Docs and runbooks**: the README (the feature list, "What's inside", "Scaling path"
   rows and their `swap-*` skills if the seam goes too), `docs/README.md`, the doc that
   covers it, the relevant `CLAUDE.md` files and rules.
8. **Tests**: its unit, integration and e2e tests go with the code; tests of other
   features that used it as a fixture move to something that stays. Keep coverage
   floors where they are; if a package's coverage drops, the remaining code lacks
   tests (the write-tests skill).
9. **Dependencies** only it used: `bun remove <pkg> --cwd <workspace>` (the user
   approves dependency changes); knip lists what's left unused.

## Done when

- `git grep -n -i "<feature>"` finds only the kept event names, audit labels and the
  later migration's plan.
- `bun run lint` (knip finds no unused files, exports or dependencies),
  `bun run check-types`, `bun run test`, `bun run test:integration`, `bun run test:e2e`,
  `bun run charts:check` pass, and `bun run gen` leaves no diff.
- The `reviewer` agent, and `docs-sync` for the docs, report nothing blocking.
