# Contributing

## Getting started

You need Node 24 (`nvm use`), Bun 1.3, Docker and uv. uv isn't only for the AI service:
code generation runs its exporter, and setup, `bun dev`, types and tests all generate
code first, so `bun run doctor` fails without it. Or open the repository in its
devcontainer (VS Code, Codespaces), which has the tools and runs setup itself.

```sh
bun run setup      # once, and after a pull that adds variables: .env, dependencies, database
bun dev            # the core services; `bun dev:full` for everything
bun run doctor     # when something looks off
```

Local services run in Docker with memory limits and their own ports, so they sit
beside other projects' containers. Docker needs about 1.4 GB free for the core
(`bun dev`, `bun run test:integration`), about 3.4 GB for the file-upload tests
(`bun run test:integration:files`, with RustFS and ClamAV) and about 3.9 GB for the full
profile (`bun dev:full`, `bun run test:coverage`); the start refuses when they don't fit
([docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md#integration) has each profile). `bun run db:down` stops them; `bun run docker:clean` removes everything this
repository created in Docker. [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) has the
fixes for what usually goes wrong.

## Making a change

1. Branch from `master`: `<type>/<what>`, with a Conventional Commits type (`feat/`,
   `fix/`, `chore/`, …); a team can add who owns it (`feat/ada/<what>`).
2. Keep to the principles in `CLAUDE.md`: fix root causes, validate at every boundary,
   one implementation per concern, services never import each other, and every
   user-facing string goes through `packages/i18n`.
3. Before pushing: `bun run lint`, `bun run check-types`, `bun run test`, and for
   anything touching the database, queues or HTTP, `bun run test:integration`.
   `bun run test:e2e` builds and starts its own stack, so stop `bun dev` first. The git
   hooks help: on commit they format and lint the staged files (Biome, ruff, Prisma,
   `tofu fmt`, Squawk on migrations), scan them for secrets with gitleaks, and run CI's
   Trivy and OSV scans when you stage infrastructure code or a lockfile (each tool
   installed at CI's version, or through Docker); on push they run every check CI would
   run on the pull request that can run on your machine, for the areas you changed
   (`scripts/pre-push.ts`, see [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md#before-a-push)). That can
   take a while for a change to shared code, and the end-to-end suite in it needs
   `bun dev` stopped; `git push --no-verify` skips it and leaves CI to decide.
4. Open a pull request. Its title becomes the squashed commit, so it follows
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) with a workspace scope:
   `feat(api): add todo sharing`, `fix(web): keep the draft on reload`. The scopes are in
   `commitlint.config.ts`. `feat` and `fix` end up in the changelog and the next version.

CI must pass (the **CI passed** check). With a single maintainer the ruleset asks for no
approval (GitHub doesn't let you approve your own pull request); once there's a team, it
asks for one from a code owner (docs/repository-settings.md).

## Database changes

- Change the schema in `packages/db/prisma/schema/` (one file per area), then
  `bun run db:migrate` to write the migration. Never edit a migration that has shipped;
  write a new one.
- Migrations deploy before the code that uses them, and the previous release keeps
  running during a rollout, so every migration must work with both. Add first, backfill,
  switch the code, and drop in a later release. `bun run db:lint` (squawk) catches the
  locking and rewriting operations that would take production down.
- Tenant tables get forced row-level security and grants for the roles that need them,
  in the same migration. The integration tests connect as those roles, so a missing
  grant or policy fails there.

## Environment variables

A new variable goes in the service's `src/env.ts` (validated at boot), `.env.example`
and `docs/environment.md`, in the same change. Features switch on when their variables
are present, so a new integration stays off until it's configured.

## Releases

Every merge to `master` deploys to staging. A release is a version tag you push
(`git tag v1.4.0 && git push origin v1.4.0`): the release notes are built from the
commit titles since the last tag. `bun run promote v1.4.0` then opens the pull request
that points production at that version's images; merging it deploys. See
`docs/deploy.md`.

## Security issues

Never in a public issue: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
